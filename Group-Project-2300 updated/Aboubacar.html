    <h1>what's a sponge cake?</h1></div>
    <p>
      Sponge cake is a light, springy cake made from flour, whisked eggs, and sugar. The defining feature of a sponge cake is the whisked eggs—the foamy structure of the eggs allows the cake to rise without baking powder or baking soda.

In the French tradition, sponge cake made by whisking whole eggs is called génoise, while sponge cake made by whisking the egg whites and egg yolks separately is known as biscuit. Some sponge cake includes the addition of cold butter, but many recipes are butter- and oil-free.

To make a chocolate sponge cake, bakers substitute cocoa powder for a portion of the flour. Chocolate sponge cake is made with cocoa powder, not melted chocolate; the cocoa powder allows the cake to keep its airy texture, but the chocolate sponge is not especially rich with chocolate flavor.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
      <li>1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon fine salt</li>
      <li>3 large eggs)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

      <li>Preparation: Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour a round cake pan (usually 8 or 9 inches). Alternatively, line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper.</li>
<li>Whipping the Eggs and Sugar: In a large bowl, combine the eggs and sugar. Using an electric mixer (stand mixer or hand mixer), beat the mixture on medium-high speed until it becomes pale, thick, and forms a ribbon when the beaters are lifted. This process can take 5-10 minutes, depending on the mixer and the freshness of the eggs. The mixture should have tripled in volume.</li>
<li>Folding in the Flour: Sift the cake flour (or all-purpose flour and cornstarch mixture) over the egg mixture. Gently fold the flour into the egg mixture using a spatula. Be careful not to overmix, as this can deflate the batter and result in a dense cake. Fold until just combined, with no streaks of flour remaining.</li>
<li>Adding Melted Butter (Optional): If using melted butter, gently fold it into a small portion of the batter first. This will temper the butter and prevent it from collapsing the entire mixture. Then, fold the butter-infused batter back into the main batter.</li>
<li>Baking: Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan and spread it evenly. Bake for 25-35 minutes, or until a wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. The cake should be golden brown on top and spring back lightly when touched.</li>
<li>Cooling: Let the cake cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes before inverting it onto a wire rack to cool completely. This prevents the cake from sticking to the pan and allows it to cool evenly.</li>
